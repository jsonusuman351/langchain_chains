Welcome to this in-depth guide on building and orchestrating **LLM Chains** with LangChain! This repository showcases how to move beyond single LLM calls and create powerful, multi-step workflows by linking models, prompts, and parsers together.

Chains are the fundamental building blocks of complex AI applications, allowing you to create sophisticated logic for tasks like question-answering, data analysis, and conditional reasoning.

### ‚ú® Core Concepts Demonstrated

This repository explores the most important and powerful chaining strategies in LangChain:

1.  **Simple Chain (`simple_chain.py`)**:
    -   The foundation of all chains. Learn how to create a basic sequence: **PromptTemplate ‚ûî LLM ‚ûî Output Parser**. This is the "Hello, World!" of LangChain and demonstrates the core concept of piping components together.

2.  **Sequential Chain (`sequential_chain.py`)**:
    -   Learn to build linear, multi-step workflows where the output of one chain becomes the input for the next. This is perfect for tasks that require a series of transformations, like generating a question and then answering it.
    -   This script demonstrates a workflow to generate a quiz question about a specific topic and then evaluate a student's answer to that question.

3.  **Parallel Chain (`parallel_chain.py`)**:
    -   Discover how to execute multiple chains simultaneously and combine their outputs. This is incredibly efficient for tasks where you need to extract multiple independent pieces of information from a single input.
    -   This script shows how to take a text about a city and extract its name, famous landmarks, and population in parallel.

4.  **Conditional Chain (`conditional_chain.py`)**:
    -   Master the art of building dynamic, intelligent workflows that can make decisions. This chain uses a classifier to route the user's query to the appropriate specialized chain (e.g., a "Math Chain" or a "History Chain").
    -   This is the key to creating AI agents that can reason about which tool or chain to use for a specific problem.

### üì∏ Demos & Visualizations

Here are screenshots and diagrams illustrating how each chain works.


**1. Sequential Chain Workflow**
*First, the chain generates a question. Then, it evaluates an answer. The diagram below shows the flow of data.*

**2. Parallel Chain Execution**
*This chain extracts multiple fields from a single text at the same time, as shown in the graph.*

**3. Conditional Chain Logic**
*The initial classifier decides which specialized chain to run based on the user's query.*
